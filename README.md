<h2> Introduction<span class="tocSkip"></span></h2>

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.

<h2> Business case<span class="tocSkip"></span></h2>

A new local company that produces good quality coffee has contacted us because they are thinking on expanding the business. Their idea is to manufacture and sell Dark chocolate, but they need to perform a roughough analysis and try to answer the following question:
    
    
    Dark Chocolate: What makes it good? 

       
To do so, they have provided us a complete dataset containing information regarding different varietes of chocolate. Each chocolate was evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. Batch numbers, vintages and review dates are included in the database when known.

The database is narrowly focused on plain dark chocolate with an aim of appreciating the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status.
